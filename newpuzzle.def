require ./newpieces.fs

\ This is the definition information for the puzzle
\ It defines the puzzle piece and the puzzle board dimentions
\ I decided to simply use forth words to do this defining so the definitions below are forth code.
\ Note at this moment i only intend to use this definition file to define one piece.  In the future maybe several pieces could be defined for a general type solving solution.
\  for now i am just working on one puzzle only 

\ Puzzle board size defined
\ length width height
5 constant x-puzzle-board
5 constant y-puzzle-board
5 constant z-puzzle-board

\ Puzzle piece definitions
\ x y z
