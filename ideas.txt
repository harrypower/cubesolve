- make a list of all pieces and generate collision table for quick testing ( 960 total pieces )
- make the pair list for all possible pairs from all possible pieces ( 766056 total pairs )
- pick a pair to solve with
- generate the union list of pieces to work with the selected pair
    - this union list is generated from the total possible pairs
    - do this by taking total list of pairs for piece a and total list of pairs for piece b
    - the final list is the union from the piece a and piece b total pair list
- now start at top of union list and
